# Pathfinder
## A fixme:continue friendly map
The initial plan is to have a map with a particular highligh on fixme:continue nodes. Following that it would be useful to offer layers that can help identifies where that "broken" path will go (maybe CTR? But globally it would be a mess)

It would be cool to have some sort of algorithm that can help to guess where the missing path will end (a particular node or another path)
